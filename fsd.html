	<p>More developers are becoming what we call full stack developers or full stack devs for short. A lot of employers (especially agencies who work on different kinds of sites) are looking for developers who know how to work on all of the parts of a site, so they can use the best tools for the job regardless — hence the rise in companies listing full stack development on job requirements.<br><br>

Now, contrary to what a lot of people think, “full stack” doesn’t necessarily mean a developer is writing all of a site’s code themselves. Many spend the majority of their time on either the client-side or the server-side.<br><br>

The point is that they know enough about the code across the entire stack that they can dive in anywhere if needed. Some full stack programmers do code entire websites, but usually only if they are working freelance or are the only developer working on a project.</p>
