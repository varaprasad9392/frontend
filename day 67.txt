i need to pay attention on my goals for what i had to be greatfull in my life for what i got both respect and 
money like my dad but i have my dream like starting a own company or startup for producing projects and gaming 
it needs to develope move i wana to write a game which is attracted but not addicted by so many kids and i need
to think an own idea for public usage and need to develop it for only good things

i have a distraction on one girl few weeks back now the girl said me that don't talk to me you are distrubing 
my feature and she rejected me without my proposal

when i said this all thing to my parents , karthik , abhinay them my parents asked me that you realyy love that 
girl if so say the matter to that girl and see what will happen if reply is positive or negative no worries
if you don't love that girl then just leave the things behing they told me that they believe in me i'll make a 
good decition 
My besties karthik and Abhinay scoulded me that it's my mistake to give lineance to her of rejecting me and he remembered me
how i was in past when compared to present this was a small disturbance
Even they said me i was still thinking of her that i really made disturbance to her if so i was only the reason 
for wasting my time for thinking about that
I can't forgot the situation i faced her for the first time:
when i was walking near the temple and talking to dad she started running towards me and taked to me i still 
remembered her expressions while taking to me

Literally then i don't know her name on new person started to chat to my personal number i didn't even think 
that she is that girl and she said let's be friends for this 4 years( i thank that she did friendship for her 
need like any thing) after a few days of chat i asked her name she said ("Pallavi") i had a great respect on 
that name becuse one of my sister has that name was died in front of my eyes

My friends started flirting me whith her name then she asked me that she'll sit beside me in online bit exam
i don't know what to do i escaped for the first mid by saying the name of Pradeep and in second min she sat 
beside me

When i was thinking that i'll be friend of her then she texted me that don't talk to me 

i realize that i shouldn't take more time to take important decition 
This is second time im my life of feeling this on waht i wanted and didn't get it 
At my age of 10 i went for Batminton practice for 3 months whithout knowing the thing in my home at the time 
of Selections the district selector called my father and said your son was in selections and said whith your permision 
we select him my father came to place of selection and take me back

I don't know why my father said no for that and i accepted it 

"Some situations makes us to make some decitons with no reason but They are mandatory situation to accept that decition"
